<!-- WEATHER APP -->

<!-- this app was built using Javascript,jQuery,CSS and HTML 
I used ajax to get my JASON data from the OPEN WEATHER API,

and I used a geolocation API that is available in HTML5 , the information is represented by Latitude and Longitude and then I sent these info for my Open weather API to get the current location, I also made to request the data using the city name. -->
